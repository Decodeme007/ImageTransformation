# ImageTransformation
The source code for this project is maintained in a private repository to protect its implementation details and development structure.
This public repository contains only the compiled deployment build, which is used for hosting the live website via GitHub Pages.

As a result, the code available here is minified and optimized for production, and does not represent the original development source.
